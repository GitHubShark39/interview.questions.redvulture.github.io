No Gaps in Employment


Great.   They were a little concerned about all the contracts you have done.
 
This is what Iâ€™m going to respond with
 
 
 
He is a true consultant.  Most of the contracts out there are 6 months long
 
I just checked through his contracts, and verified that most of them lasted at least this long
 
And he has practically no gaps
 
He was very excited to learn that this was a long term contract though
 
He began his career in Southern California and would love to come back for something long term
