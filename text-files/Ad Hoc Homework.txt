Ad Hoc Homework



? Reply above this line
Hi Royal!
Thanks so much for your interest in joining Ad Hoc. We grew from the original rescue effort of healthcare.gov to a 
team dedicated to improving the services that the government provides to people.
I know you’ve invested time and attention into this application, and I want to let you know that we will do the same. 
We want the people we hire to have as much impact as the services we build.
We don’t shy away from having a highly selective application process, and you'll talk to a lot of people. 
We don’t want to hire you for a project, we want to hire you for a career.

Since we're a remote company and don't do in-person interviews, the first step in our technical interview process is our 
coding challenge: https://github.com/adhocteam/adhoc_homework.

If you have any questions, If you'd like to find out more about Ad Hoc, and the kinds of projects we have going on, or 
if you have any questions on the homework, we encourage you to join our public slack channel and speak with us there.

For now, if you would select just one problem to complete and when you are done with the homework you should submit 
it here., we will review those results and advise regarding next steps.

Looking forward to reviewing your submission and to talking more soon!

Thanks!
Joe McMonagle
