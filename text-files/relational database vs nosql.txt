relational database vs nosql


What is the difference between a database and a relational database?
The key difference is that RDBMS (relational database management system) applications 
store data in a tabular form, while DBMS applications store data as files. Does that 
mean there are no tables in a DBMS? There can be, but there will be no “relation” 
between the tables, like in a RDBMS.Aug 24, 2013
