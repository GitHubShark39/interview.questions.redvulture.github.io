Upstream Module
In order to set up a round robin load balancer, we will need to use the nginx upstream module. We will incorporate the configuration into the nginx settings.

Go ahead and open up your website’s configuration (in my examples I will just work off of the generic default virtual host):

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
We need to add the load balancing configuration to the file.

First we need to include the upstream module which looks like this:

upstream backend  {
  server backend1.example.com;
  server backend2.example.com;
  server backend3.example.com;
}
We should then reference the module further on in the configuration:

 server {
  location / {
    proxy_pass  http://backend;
  }
}
Restart nginx:

sudo service nginx restart
