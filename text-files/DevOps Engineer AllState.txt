level of knowledge through your answers. Do not provide a Yes or NO one word answer.

Additional hiring manager comments about previous problems during the interviews:
- A little hard to understand (talked to fast or to quietly)
- Answers were not clear or to the point when asked about previous employment roles/responsibilities listed in the resume.
- Had responsibilities listed in his DevOps role of a Developer or a Build Engineer
- When asked about daily tasks or issues encountered, it was more of a team effort to resolve them
- It seemed that the existing configuration management tools were pre-existing and reused
 
 
Good luck and please call post interview to give me your impression on how it went,
